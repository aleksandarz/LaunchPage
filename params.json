{"name":"Launchpage","tagline":"An easy landing page to collect signups and allow visitors to share a trackable URL","body":"# LaunchPage\r\n**This is a quick and easy viral landing page that allows visitors to sign up, share a custom URL, and track how many referals they generated.** LaunchPage was developed and is maintained by [@kimmanis](https://twitter.com/kimmanis) and [@drigotti](https://twitter.com/drigotti).\r\n\r\nBelow are two screenshots (homepage and sharing page) of [pressrm.com](http://www.pressrm.com/), a site that was built using the LaunchPage, with some basic CSS modifications:\r\n[![ScreenShot](http://i.imgur.com/Kc9SIwf.png)](http://www.pressrm.com)\r\n\r\n[![ScreenShot](http://i.imgur.com/EPDOhcB.png)](http://www.pressrm.com)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n1. Fork the repo\r\n2. Run rake db:migrate\r\n3. Customize UI as needed, more information below\r\n4. Change admin password\r\n5. Deploy\r\n\r\n## Customization\r\nLaunchPage is designed to be a fully customizable landing page, so that it's unique to your site and delivers the highest conversion rates.\r\n\r\n### CSS\r\nLaunchPage is built on Bootstrap. More information on site structure and css settings can be found in the [ Bootstrap docs](http://getbootstrap.com/css/).\r\n\r\n### Homepage\r\nThe homepage is a simple form asking for the user's email address. This is the page users will see when they visit your site. It can be found at **views/users/new**\r\n\r\n### Confirmation & Share Page:\r\nThe confirmation and share page shows immediately after the user has provided their email address. This page includes his/her trackable referral URL and share buttons. It can be found at **views/users/show**\r\n\r\n### Admin\r\nThe admin page is where you can view how many people have registered and access their email address. You can edit this file at **views/lock/unlock** though you shouldn't need to.\r\n\r\nTo access registrations, visit http://www.yoursitehere.com/lock/login. The default password is \"password\". To change it, overwrite the password file using the following command:\r\n     <code>rails g lock:create_password_file yourpasswordhere</code>\r\n\r\nFor more on lock can be found on the [lock gem website](http://www.cowboycoded.com/2011/04/11/lock-down-a-rails-3-app-with-a-single-password-using-lock/).\r\n\r\n### Application\r\nSitewide changes (such as the navigation bar), can be made from **views/layouts/application**\r\n\r\n### Config\r\nOpen the **config/application.yml** file to change the following:\r\n- Google analytics (e.g. UA-)\r\n- SEO meta information (e.g. description)\r\n- Facebook meta and social sharing (e.g. share copy and Twitter handle)\r\n\r\n## Deploying\r\nThis code uses SQLite for development but PostgreSQL for production. This is because Heroku only supports PostgreSQL but it's a pain to set up locally. You need to have Heroku installed and set up already for all this goodness to work. Detailed instructions can be found in the [Heroku getting started guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3).\r\n\r\nTo create a new heroku site: <code>heroku apps:create exampleName</code>\r\n\r\nThen deploy to heroku (ensure changes already committed): <code>git push heroku master</code>\r\n\r\nThen set up the database: <code>heroku run rake db:migrate</code>\r\n\r\nIf the CSS isn't showing up correctly, you may want to precompile assets and push everything again: <code>rake assets:precompile</code>\r\n\r\n## License & Attribution\r\nThis code is released under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Parts of this code may be covered under separate license. While not required, we do ask for a link on your land page back to this page, so others can discover and build upon the work.","google":"UA-43479245-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
